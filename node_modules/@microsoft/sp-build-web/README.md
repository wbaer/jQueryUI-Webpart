# sp-build-web

This package is intended to be imported directly by a [gulpfile](http://gulpjs.com/)
that uses the SharePoint Framework build system.  It imports and configures a set of
build tasks that are appropriate for a build target that will run in a web browser
(e.g. versus a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) environment).

*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx),
which is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences
for [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).
For more information, including complete API documentation and code samples, please visit
