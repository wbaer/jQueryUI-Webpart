 * ITokenUtilityContext which abstracts the basic services that are needed by that
 * code. TokenUtilityContext is our adapter that wires up this interface to the
 * corresponding services in sp-client-base; it can be considered part of the
 * internal implementation of DelegationTokenProvider; it is not intended to be
 * used by other parts of our framework.
